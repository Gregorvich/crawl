<localtiles>, or by clicking on 'autoexplore', the first button in the command
bar below the minimap.</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial1 exclusion

Some dangerous ground is marked with <w>exclusions</w>. Autotravel

# Tutorial map 2: Monsters and combat        #
##############################################
tutorial2 start

This lesson will teach you about monsters and fighting. First, we need a
weapon! Go and grab the one lying over there.
%%%%
tutorial2 pickup_weapon

Pick up this weapon<localtiles> by clicking on it in the inventory panel, and
then wield it by clicking on it again. Alternatively, pick it up</localtiles>
with <input>$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]</input> or <input>g</input> and then wield it with
<input>$cmd[CMD_WIELD_WEAPON]</input>.
%%%%
tutorial2 melee

To attack a monster with your bare hands or wielded weapon, simply walk into
it.
%%%%
tutorial2 resting

Very good! You can heal by resting with <input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input>
<localtiles>, or by clicking the 'rest' button in the command bar below the
minimap</localtiles>. This will make you rest until your health is full, but
will be interrupted by important events.
%%%%
tutorial2 chop_corpses

While standing on corpses, you can chop them into edible meat chunks with
<input>$cmd[CMD_BUTCHER]</input><localtiles> or <input>Shift +
mouseclick</input></localtiles>. When you're hungry, you can eat the resulting
chunks with <input>$cmd[CMD_EAT]</input><localtiles> or
<input>mouseclick</input></localtiles>. If you grow hungry while autoexploring,
you will automatically eat a chunk of meat if one is available.
%%%%
tutorial2 rest_and_chop_reminder

Don't forget about chopping corpses for food (with
<input>$cmd[CMD_BUTCHER]</input><localtiles> or <input>Shift +
mouseclick</input></localtiles>), or resting (with
<input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input><localtiles> or the button in the command
bar</localtiles>)!
%%%%
tutorial2 wait

Rather than storm the room and get swarmed by monsters, you can also step back
and wait (with <input>$cmd[CMD_WAIT]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>clicking</input> on your character</localtiles>) for them to come to you.
%%%%
tutorial2 resting_reminder

Remember, you can rest up with <input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input>.
%%%%
tutorial2 eat_reminder

Remember, you can chop creatures up with <input>$cmd[CMD_BUTCHER]</input>
<localtiles> or <input>Shift + mouseclick</input></localtiles>, and then eat
the resulting chunks with <input>$cmd[CMD_EAT]</input><localtiles> or
<input>mouseclick</input></localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial2 compare_monster_desc

# The keyboard commands are skipped in localtiles for clarity.
Examine these monsters (<localtiles>via <input>mouseover</input></localtiles>
<nomouse>by pressing <input>$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]</input> to enter examine mode,
and then <input>$cmd[CMD_TARGET_CYCLE_FORWARD]</input> to cycle through nearby

and compare their descriptions (<localtiles>with <input>rightmouseclick</input></localtiles>
<nomouse>by pressing <input>$cmd[CMD_TARGET_DESCRIBE]</input> while selecting
them in examine mode</nomouse>)
to find out which of these cages is safer to fight through.
%%%%
tutorial2 downstairs

<input>$cmd[CMD_TARGET_SELECT]</input> or <input>Enter</input>.
%%%%
tutorial2 wield_bow

Pick up this shortbow and wield it with <input>$cmd[CMD_WIELD_WEAPON]</input>
<localtiles> or by <input>mouseclick</input></localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial2 firing

# FIXME: Lengthy because of the hint for choosing target.
Firing arrows from your wielded shortbow works exactly the same as throwing tomahawks:
via <input>$cmd[CMD_FIRE]</input><localtiles> or <input>mouseclick</input>
</localtiles>. You can change the targeted monster by pressing
<input>$cmd[CMD_TARGET_CYCLE_FORWARD]</input> while in target mode. The worm is
harmless behind the lava, so concentrate on the dummy which can fire at you.
Again, confirm your choice with <input>$cmd[CMD_TARGET_SELECT]</input> or
<input>Enter</input>.
%%%%
tutorial2 travel_reminder

Remember that you can autoexplore using <input>$cmd[CMD_EXPLORE]</input>.

# Tutorial map 3: Items and Inventory #
#######################################
tutorial3 start

In this lesson you're going to learn about items and how to use them.
%%%%
tutorial3 armour

Pick up these boots with <input>$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]</input> and wear them with
<input>$cmd[CMD_WEAR_ARMOUR]</input>.<localtiles> Or simply
<input>mouseclick</input> on them in the inventory panel.</localtiles>
%%%%
tutorial3 autopickup

Some types of items<tiles>, marked with a green frame,</tiles> are picked up
automatically as you step on them.
%%%%
tutorial3 scroll

Many items are unidentified when you find them. One way to find out what they
do is to use them. Try reading this scroll with <input>$cmd[CMD_READ]</input>
<localtiles> or with <input>mouseclick</input> in the inventory
panel</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial3 scroll_noautopickup

Autopickup does not work if there's a monster around. You can either pick up
this scroll now with <input>$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]</input><localtiles> or
<input>clicking</input> on your character,</localtiles> or you can fight the
nearby enemy and pick it up afterwards.
%%%%
tutorial3 ego_weapon

An item described as <lightblue>runed</lightblue> or
<lightblue>glowing</lightblue> will always be enchanted, or have special
properties, or both. You need to wield this scimitar (with
<input>$cmd[CMD_WIELD_WEAPON]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>clicking</input> on it in the inventory panel</localtiles>) to find out
what those are.
%%%%
tutorial3 inventory

# TODO: Should give tutorial messages inside the inventory to find the weapon.
#       Maybe there should also be a separate lesson to highlight the commands
#       in the item description screen.
To view the description of your new weapon, find and select it in your
inventory (<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_INVENTORY]</input>). <localtiles>You can
also <input>mouseover</input> or <input>right click</input> it in the inventory
panel. </localtiles>Notice that all the item commands also work from the item
description screens.
%%%%
tutorial3 battle

Once you've successfully managed to poison a monster, it is sometimes best to
retreat and let the poison do the work. Don't forget to retreat to heal too, if
necessary.
%%%%
tutorial3 downstairs

Well fought! If necessary, rest up with <input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input>, then
continue downwards with <input>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</input><localtiles> or
with a <input>click</input> on your character</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial3 command_help

If the many commands are too confusing, you can also look them up in the
command help <input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]</input>. <localtiles>A number of
commands are also available in the clickable <w>command panel</w> to the right
of the screen. </localtiles>Rereading old messages with
<input>$cmd[CMD_REPLAY_MESSAGES]</input> is available as usual.
%%%%
tutorial3 trap

Traps can have a variety of unpleasant effects, such as alerting monsters or
teleporting you into danger. They will often be hidden until you discover them
by stepping on them. If there's no way around, you'll have to trigger the trap
and deal with the consequences.
%%%%
tutorial3 potion

Potions may provide vital healing or useful enchantments, but some have less
desirable effects. You can quaff this potion with
<input>$cmd[CMD_QUAFF]</input><localtiles> or with
<input>mouseclick</input></localtiles> to discover what it does.
%%%%
tutorial3 artefact_armour

# TODO: Replace unrandart with a real randart. Needs some safeguarding against
#       things that would throw the tutorial off rails (cursed, Cursing,
#       mutations, activatable abilities..)
Items with <w>unusual names</w> are artefacts. Artefacts can have a number of
special properties. Some items (such as this cloak) are known and come
pre-identified, others are random and have unknown properties. Try equipping
this cloak with <input>$cmd[CMD_WEAR_ARMOUR]</input><localtiles> or
<input>mouseclick</input> in the inventory panel</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial3 wand_fire

# TODO: The wand targeting screen could perhaps use a little context help.
You can evoke a wand with <input>$cmd[CMD_EVOKE]</input><localtiles> or with
<input>mouseclick</input> in the inventory panel</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial3 wand_digging

A wand of digging can destroy rock walls. Use
<input>$cmd[CMD_LOOK_AROUND]][$cmd[CMD_TARGET_DESCRIBE]</input> <localtiles>or
<input>mouseover</input>/<input>right click</input> </localtiles>to check wall
types.
%%%%
tutorial3 amulet

Jewellery is put on with <input>$cmd[CMD_WEAR_JEWELLERY]</input><localtiles>
or with <input>mouseclick</input> in the inventory panel</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial3 scroll_remove_curse

The amulet is cursed and will not come off on its own. This scroll will remove
all curses that are placed upon you. Try reading it with
<input>$cmd[CMD_READ]</input><localtiles> or by <input>clicking</input> it in
the inventory panel</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial3 drop

The amulet is useless; you may want to drop it with
<input>$cmd[CMD_DROP]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>Shift-leftclicking</input> it in the inventory panel</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial3 gold

Gold can be spent in shops. It takes no inventory space and cannot be dropped.
%%%%
tutorial3 shop

Shops offer a variety of items, but they don't buy items from anyone.
%%%%
tutorial3 enter_shop

# TODO: Everything else except how to enter the shop should be told in the
#       shopping screen.
To enter this shop, press <input>$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]</input><localtiles> or
<input>click</input> on your character</localtiles>. To buy items,
select them with their hotkey, hit <input>Enter</input> and confirm with
<input>y</input>es. You can switch to description mode with <input>!</input>.
%%%%
tutorial3 autoexplore_reminder

Remember, you can explore the level automatically with
<input>$cmd[CMD_EXPLORE]</input><localtiles> or by <input>clicking</input> the
autoexplore command button in the <w>command panel</w></localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial3 go_shopping

# TODO: Should only instruct to start the search here, and put the rest of the
#       instructions into the search screen. Also, it would be good to highlight
#       the search button in the command panel somehow when this message is
#       viewed.
You now have enough gold to do some serious shopping! The quickest way back to
the shop is by searching for it. Type <input>$cmd[CMD_SEARCH_STASHES]</input>,
and then enter “<w>shop</w>”. Select the result to start traveling.<localtiles>
You can also <input>click</input> on the search button in the command panel, or
use the minimap to return to the shop.</localtiles>
%%%%
tutorial3 optional_battle

Warning, this way leads to <lightred>a difficult battle</lightred>. You may
choose to use what you've learned so far in a fight, or try to reach the other
exit on the island. Either way, it may be a good idea to do some shopping, if
you haven't already.

##############################################
# Tutorial map 4: Magic and Spellcasting     #
##############################################
tutorial4 start

In this lesson you're going to learn how to memorize and cast spells.
%%%%
tutorial4 spellbook

You can memorise a spell from a carried spellbook with
<input>$cmd[CMD_MEMORISE_SPELL]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>clicking</input> on the memorisation tab and selecting the spell
tile</localtiles>. At experience level 1, only level 1 spells are available to
you. This will change as you gain experience.
%%%%
tutorial4 spellcasting

## TODO: A bit long at once. Idea for splitting: make the dummy not fight back
##       by not giving them ammo, put the resting message further down the way.
##       Tiles memorization: clicking on a spellbook in the inventory might be
##       easier to grasp; could leave the memorisation tab to be discovered by
##       the player on their own.
You can cast spells with <input>$cmd[CMD_CAST_SPELL]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>clicking</input> on the spell tile</localtiles>. Press
<input>$cmd[CMD_CAST_SPELL]?</input> to get a list of your spells.

Once you are out of magic points, retreat and rest to regain them with
<input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input><localtiles> or by <input>clicking</input> the
rest icon in the command panel</localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial4 ring_power

Put on this ring with <input>$cmd[CMD_WEAR_JEWELLERY]</input><localtiles> or
by <input>clicking</input> it in the inventory panel</localtiles>, and then
rest up to your new full potential.
%%%%
tutorial4 undead

# TODO: This is more like hints mode stuff. Not sure if there's any harm though,
#       and the mouse interface hint is good.
Unlike most monsters, zombies and skeletons do not regenerate health.
<localtiles> You can also attempt to re-cast the last spell you used by
pressing <input>Ctrl+leftclick</input> on the monster.</localtiles>
%%%%
tutorial4 spell_success

To check your spell proficiency, press <input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_SPELLS]</input>
<localtiles> or <input>mouseover</input> over your memorised
spells</localtiles>. Compare your spell failure rates before and after wielding
this staff.
%%%%
tutorial4 mephitic_cloud

Mephitic Cloud is a level 3 spell, so you can't memorise it yet. To level up
quickly, here are more training dummies — without stones to throw this time.

At experience level 3, you'll be able to increase one of your stats — choosing
<input>I</input>ntelligence will help your spellcasting even further.
%%%%
tutorial4 meph_reminder

Don't forget to memorise your newly-available spell, by pressing
<input>$cmd[CMD_MEMORISE_SPELL]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>clicking</input> on the memorisation tab and selecting the spell
tile</localtiles>!
%%%%
tutorial4 aiming_clouds

Mephitic Cloud covers an area in noxious fumes when cast, and you'll be able to
see the area it affects as you target it. Try to catch multiple enemies in a
single cloud in order to be more efficient with your magic.
%%%%
tutorial4 spell_hunger

Spellcasting can make you really hungry. Spell hunger is higher for more
difficult spells and can be reduced by high intelligence and by training the
Spellcasting skill.
%%%%
tutorial4 forget_spell

Gaining an experience level and raising your Spellcasting skill gives you spell
slots to spend on spells. You can also <w>forget a memorised spell</w> to make
space for a new one. The easiest way to do this is with a scroll of amnesia.
Simply read the scroll (with <input>$cmd[CMD_READ]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>clicking</input> on it</localtiles>), and then select the spell you want
to forget.
%%%%
tutorial4 memorise2

Again, memorise a new spell with <input>$cmd[CMD_MEMORISE_SPELL]</input>
<localtiles> or by <input>clicking</input> on the memorisation tab and
selecting the spell tile</localtiles>. And then raise yourself an undead army!
%%%%
tutorial4 displace_allies

Did you notice you can swap positions with your allies by moving into them?
Among other things, displacing a friendly creature can be a good way to escape
a fight.
%%%%
tutorial4 order_allies

Try to let your allies do the killing! If necessary, you can order them about
with <input>$cmd[CMD_SHOUT]</input>. Before opening this gate, you may want to
wait with <input>$cmd[CMD_WAIT]</input> until your allies have caught
up with you.
%%%%
tutorial4 heavy_armour

# TODO: Split taking off into separate item.
Heavy armour really hampers spellcasting. Try putting on that mail and shield
(with <input>$cmd[CMD_WEAR_ARMOUR]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>clicking</input> on them</localtiles>), and compare your spellcasting
failure rates with <input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_SPELLS]</input><localtiles> or by
<input>mouseovering</input> your memorised spells</localtiles>. You can take
armour off again with <input>$cmd[CMD_REMOVE_ARMOUR]</input><localtiles> or,
again, via <input>mouseclick</input></localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial4 resting_reminder

Make sure you are at full health and magic points before entering a new area.
If necessary, rest up with <input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input><localtiles> or by

Also, undead don't breathe, so you can cast Mephitic Cloud without harming your
allies.

# Tutorial map 5: Gods and divine abilities  #
##############################################
tutorial5 start

In this lesson you're going to learn about gods and how to use their powers.
%%%%
tutorial5 dungeon_overview

Up ahead is an altar to Trog the Wrathful! Trog is just one of many gods. In a
real game, you can check <input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_OVERMAP]</input><localtiles>
or <input>click the dungeon overmap button</input> in the command
panel</localtiles> for a list of all altars and other interesting features
found so far.
%%%%
tutorial5 altar

You can pray on an altar with <input>$cmd[CMD_GO_DOWNSTAIRS]</input>
<localtiles> (or by <input>left clicking</input> on your character)</localtiles>
to get an idea what a god offers you, and to join the faith. If
you press <input>!</input><localtiles> or
<input>rightclick</input></localtiles> on the religion screen, you can see a
more detailed description.

Confirm your choice with an uppercase <input>Y</input>.
%%%%
tutorial5 religion

Have a look at your current religious standing with
<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_RELIGION]</input><localtiles> (or via the <w>religion
button</w> in the command panel, or by <input>Shift-rightclicking</input> on
the player tile)</localtiles>. Again, pressing <input>!</input><localtiles> or
<input>rightclicking</input></localtiles> will bring up a more detailed
description of your god.
%%%%
tutorial5 piety_on_kill

Some gods really like it if you kill monsters in their name. Let the slaughter
begin!
%%%%
tutorial5 berserk

Against particularly tough foes, you may want to use Trog's Berserk power with
<input>$cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]</input><localtiles> or via the <w>command
panel</w></localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial5 exhaustion

A berserker rage is truly exhausting. While fatigued, you cannot berserk again
and are also slowed. It's best to rest with <input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input>
<localtiles> (or via the <w>command panel</w>)</localtiles> until you feel fit
again.
%%%%
tutorial5 hunger

Berserking also causes a large amount of hunger. You cannot berserk while very
hungry, so you should always carry some food with you.
%%%%
tutorial5 berserk2

Berserk is also really useful against multiple enemies — as long as you don't
run out of steam in-between.
%%%%
tutorial5 tutorial_end

Congratulations! You've finished the last tutorial lesson and are now ready for
the real game. Good luck!

############################################
# Tutorial 6: Brief tutorial for arena map #
############################################
tutorial6 start

As you rest in the cabin of your ship, you feel the ship steadily come to
a halt. "Land ho! Land ho!" You hear from the deck just outside of your
cabin. It seems that the merchant ship you hired came through on its
promise to deliver you to the country of Grim Haven, a land ripe with
monsters and ruined villages. There is, however, one attraction that
brings adventurers and civilians alike to this desolate land: The Arena.
The Arena is a proving ground filled with the dangerous monsters that
foolhardy merchants have gathered from the continent in order to provide
a spectacle for those who have scarcely witnessed monsters before. Although
it has this less than glorifying reputation, it has still served as a
gathering place for legendary heros who wish to show their mettle.
Reputation gains are hardly important to you, but the opportunity to
face challenging monsters sets your blood on fire in a way that nothing
else can. And if you rid the world of a few of those savage beasts in the 
process, all the better. You have journeyed to this land to enter into the 
arena and spill some blood. Good luck!
%%%%
tutorial6 movement

Use the <input>Arrow Keys</input> to move around. You can also move by clicking somewhere
with your <input>Mouse</input>. Follow the blue pads to continue the tutorial.
%%%%
tutorial6 viewing_messages

Press <input>$cmd[CMD_REPLAY_MESSAGES]</input> to get a full list of all of
your messages.
%%%%
tutorial6 sprinting

Hold <input>Shift</input> along with the <input>Arrow Keys</input> to move
in the specified direction quickly
%%%%
tutorial6 diagonal_movement

You can move diagonally by using the <input>Number Pad</input>.
%%%%
tutorial6 opening_doors

You can open closed doors by walking into them
%%%%
tutorial6 closing_doors

You may wish to close doors you have opened. To do this, press <input>$cmd[CMD_CLOSE_DOOR]</input>.
Try it on the door you have just opened.
%%%%
tutorial6 water

Notice how you can move through shallow water but not deep water.
%%%%
tutorial6 weapons

Stepping on one of the blue squares will result in a helpful message popping up,
like this one. If you ever feel lost, just keep an eye out for one of these. Now,
you are currently unarmed and are in no state to defend yourself. Go retrieve
your weapons and armour.
%%%%
tutorial6 picking_up_items

<input>$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]</input> picks up items from the ground. Items you 
can pickup are also displayed on the bottom of the inventory panel. You 
can also pick up the items by clicking on them here.
%%%%
tutorial6 equipping_items

<input>$cmd[CMD_WIELD_WEAPON]</input> displays your inventory in a grid.
This is a typical way Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup displays selection options.
From here you can select what you want to equip and press enter, or, 
alternatively, you can equip items by simply clicking on them in the 
inventory panel.
%%%%
tutorial6 armour

Now go retrieve your armour. Pick it up using <input>$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]</input>,
and press <input>$cmd[CMD_WEAR_ARMOUR]</input> or click on the armour to wear it.
%%%%
tutorial6 adventuring_1

Great! You are now prepared to disembark onto the shore. Move west and
then try to make your way north.
%%%%
tutorial6 combat_1

You can attack enemies by simply walking into them.
%%%%
tutorial6 combat_2

After combat, it is usually a good idea to rest. This will restore your 
health and magic points as long as there are no enemies around. Press
<input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input> to rest.
%%%%
tutorial6 food

Before continuing, this is a good opportunity to discuss food. As you perform
actions such as moving and attacking, you will get more hungry. If you don't
keep your nutrition up, you will eventually starve to death and die. So, it is
a good idea to stock up on food, and one way to do this is to butcher monster
corpses. You can butcher corpses by standing over them and pressing
<input>$cmd[CMD_BUTCHER]</input>. Try doing this on the rats you have just
killed.
%%%%
tutorial6 options

Continuing north will lead to an area where you can learn the more
advanced mechanics of Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. If you would rather skip
the rest of the tutorial, then you can head to The Arena (west) or pick
a religion in the cathedral (north east). (For the sake of the study, go
through the tutorial). It is strongly recommended to play through the rest
of the tutorial if this is your first playthrough.
%%%%
tutorial6 adventuring_2

Great choice! Just keep heading north along the path and follow the blue
squares.
%%%%
tutorial6 examining_enemies_1

Before engaging in combat, it can be a good idea to know what you're in for.
Hovering the mouse over an enemy or any environmental feature will display
a brief explanation of it. You may notice that, later, many of the structures
are called "statues." Don't worry about that. You can display even more
information about an enemy with <input>Right Mouseclick</input>, such
as its health and the maximum damage it can deal.
%%%%
tutorial6 examining_enemies_2

Try to determine which route is the safest by examining the enemies.
%%%%
tutorial6 leveling_up

You have just leveled up! Leveling up results in more health and magic
points, and it will also occasionally increase one of your attributes-
strength, intelligence, or dexterity.
%%%%
tutorial6 skills_1

Along with your three core attributes, you also have a very particular
set of skills, skills that you have acquired over a long period of time.
*Ahem*. To view these, click on the skills tile on the top of the inventory
panel.
%%%%
tutorial6 skills_2

Skills are leveled up by acquiring regular combat experience. The orange
percentages show how much of your experience is contributing to a
particular skill. Greyed out skills are not currently being trained.
Naturally, having less skills selected as being trained will increase
the amount of experience gained by those that are set to be trained. You
can toggle which skills you'd like to focus on by clicking on them.
%%%%
tutorial6 skills_3

Skills are an important aspect of DDSS, as they determine how much benefit
you will receive out of your equipment. For example, increasing the armour
skill reduces the penalty of armour weight, increases armour rating for
heavier armour, and increases your chance of successfully casting spells
while wearing heavier armour (More on spellcasting later). To view a
description of what skills do, click on the skill tab to the left of the
inventory panel and hover over skills you'd like to learn about.
%%%%
tutorial6 ranged_combat_1

Okay! Let's move onto the art of ranged combat. First of all, pick up
the tomahawks left on the ground.
%%%%
tutorial6 ranged_combat_2

To fire ammunition at an enemy, press <input>$cmd[CMD_FIRE]</input>. This
will automatically select an enemy for you. You can then switch between
enemies by using the arrow keys. Alternatively, you can click on the item
in your inventory and manually select an enemy to fire at.
%%%%
tutorial6 ranged_combat_3

Try to kill the encampment of goblins on the opposite side of the river.
Don't worry about the goblin with the dagger; it cannot reach you from there.
This is a good tactic to keep in mind: focus your fire on the most immediate
threat when attacking from range.
%%%%
tutorial6 ranged_combat_4

Bows work the same as tomahawks, granted you will need both a bow and arrows
to use them.
%%%%
tutorial6 auto_pickup_1

Some items are picked up automatically when you walk over them. These items
will have a green frame over them.
%%%%
tutorial6 identification

Most items you find on the ground come unidentified, meaning you know what
the object is, but little else about it. One way to identify the properties
of an object is to use it. Try this on the scroll you just picked up.
<input>$cmd[CMD_READ]</input> will bring up a menu of readable items in your
inventory.
%%%%
tutorial6 help

If you are ever getting overwhelmed by the number of key commands,
<input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_COMMANDS]</input> will give you a list of categories
for the different commands. Selecting a category will give you all of the
commands related to that category.
%%%%
tutorial6 auto_pickup_2

Auto-pickup will not work when there is an enemy around. To pick up this
item, either do so manually or defeat the enemy first.
%%%%
tutorial6 enchanted_items

Blue items will always be enchanted, or have special properties, or both. You
will need to wield the item to find out what those properties are.
%%%%
tutorial6 examining_items

You can get a brief summary of an item's stats by hovering your mouse over it.
You can also get a more detailed explanation of the item by 
<input>Mouse Rightclicking</input> it.
%%%%
tutorial6 poisoned_weapons

A good tactic for using poisoned weapons is to poison an enemy and to quickly
retreat afterwords. Try doing this to defeat the next group of enemies.
Remember that positioning is key in winning your battles, and knowing
when to retreat is a part of this.
%%%%
tutorial6 potions_1

Potions are vital to survival, as they provide ever important healing
benefits and other useful enchantments. They can also, however, have
undesirable effects. Press <input>$cmd[CMD_QUAFF]</input> to quaff
(drink) a potion, or alternatively click on it in your inventory. These 
healing potions will probably be useful for the rest of the
tutorial.
%%%%
tutorial6 picking_up_many_items

There is currently a lot of items on the floor, and pressing
<input>$cmd[CMD_PICKUP]</input> will result in a menu appearing. Simply
select what you want to pickup and press <input>ENTER</input>. Remember 
that you can also click on the items from the inventory panel that you'd
like to pickup.
%%%%
tutorial6 artifacts

Items with unique names are artifacts. Artifacts can have a number of unique
properties, and some will give you new abilities. Press
<input>$cmd[CMD_USE_ABILITY]</input> to look at your abilities or to use 
one of them. You can also access your abilities by clicking on the abilities
tab to the left of your inventory.
%%%%
tutorial6 wands

Wands are used by evoking them <input>$cmd[CMD_EVOKE]</input>. They are
reliable for attacking at long range and typically deal a large amount of
damage, which can be increased by training invocations. There is another
nasty kobold down the hallway around the next corner; use this wand to
gain an edge against it.
%%%%
tutorial6 increasing_attributes

As mentioned before, you will occasionally get to increase an attribute
when you level up. This will occur every three levels. The breakdown of
the three attributes are as follows: \n
<red>Strength- makes heavy armor less cumbersome and slightly increases weapon
damage.</red> \n
<lightblue>Intelligence- makes your spells more reliable and powerful.</lightblue> \n
<yellow>Dexterity- increases your evasion and stealth.</yellow>
%%%%
tutorial6 jewelry_1

Oh look, a shiny amulet. Why don't you go ahead and equip it?
%%%%
tutorial6 jewelry_2

Oops! As it turns out that amulet was cursed. Cursed equipment is usually
detrimental to your stats, and cannot be removed once equipped. No need to
worry though, scrolls of remove curse can be used to lift the curses from
all equipment you are wearing. You just need to go find one.
%%%%
tutorial6 jewelry_3

Lifting the curse from cursed equipment does not remove the penalties the
item gives you- it simply allows you to remove it. You might as well drop
the amulet once you've used the scroll. Press <input>$cmd[CMD_DROP]</input>
to drop items from your inventory, or <input>Shift Leftclick</input> the item you
want to drop.
%%%%
tutorial6 shops_1

Shops offer a variety of items, from armour to scrolls to potions. You are
not able to sell any items to them, however. To access a shop's inventory,
press <input>$cmd[CMD_GO_UPSTAIRS]</input>. To buy items, select the items
you want to buy, press <input>Enter</input>, and confirm the choice with
<input>y</input>es. Pressing <input>!</input> will cause selecting an item
to pull up a more detailed description of it.
%%%%
tutorial6 intro_to_magic

Next, you will learn the art of using magic. To acquire new spells, you
must get access to spellbooks. Picking up a spellbook automatically
adds any spells in it to your list of spells. Pick up the spellbook on
the ground.
%%%%
tutorial6 memorisation_1

The next step to using a spell is to memorise it. Press
<input>$cmd[CMD_MEMORISE_SPELL]</input> to access your list of spells 
and memorise one of them. You can also click on the memorise tab to the 
left of the inventory menu. Try to memorise Flame tongue.
%%%%
tutorial6 memorisation_2

You may have noticed the numbers next to each spell in the memorisation
menu. This indicates how many spell points you need to spend to unlock
a spell. The amount of spell points you need to spend for a spell is called
a spell's "level." At level 1, only level 1 spells are available to you,
but this will change as you gain experience.
%%%%
tutorial6 casting_spells

Use your new found power to defeat the enemies. You can cast spells by
pressing <input>$cmd[CMD_CAST_SPELL]</input>, or by clicking on the spell's tile above
the inventory menu. As you learn spells, they will be assigned to keys in
alphebitically order, so you can cast your first spell with "z" and then
"lowercase a", and your second spell with "z" and then "lowercase b", and so on.
Pressing "z" followed by "enter" will cause you to cast the spell you used
most recently.
%%%%
tutorial6 spell_menu

Press <input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_SPELLS]</input> to look at all of your memorised spells. You
can also select which spell you would like to cast by pressing
<input>z?</input> together.
%%%%
tutorial6 regaining_mana

Remember that resting regenerates your mana as well as your health. If
necessary, retreat and rest to regenerate your mana to continue to cast
your spells.
%%%%
tutorial6 miscasting_spells

Now that you have literally warmed your hands when it comes to magic, lets
take this moment to discuss some of the more technical aspects of magic. First
off, miscasting spells. Miscasting spells can result in nasty consequences.
The more difficult the spell, the more nasty these consequences will be. You
can increase your chance of successfully casting a spell by increasing your
magic related skills. It can also be improved with the help of some items.
You can see your chance of miscasting spells by hovering your mouse over
the appropriate spell, or by pressing <input>$cmd[CMD_DISPLAY_SPELLS]</input>.
%%%%
tutorial6 recasting_spells

You can quickly recast the last spell you used on a monster with
<input>Ctrl+Leftclick</input>.
%%%%
tutorial6 staves

Staves, despite being poor melee weapons, can be used to increase your
proficiency with casting spells. Here is a staff for free to get you started.
Notice the improvement of your spell success chance after equipping the staff.
Staves can have other effects as well, such as increasing the damage of certain
spells and increasing your AC (armour rating).
%%%%
tutorial6 spells_and_hunger

Casting spells will make you very hungry. The more difficult the spell,
the hungrier the spell will make you. This can be reduced by increasing your
intelligence stat and by training the spellcasting skill. Fortunately,
it seems like the kobolds were having a pizza party here, so you can take
some of that with you.
%%%%
tutorial6 spell_slots

The number of spells you can memorise limits the number of spell slots
you can have. Additional slots can be gained by gaining levels and by
raising your spellcasting skill. 
%%%%
tutorial6 necromancy_1

Time for something a little more interesting. Head south past the gate and
then west into the area with the pond.
%%%%
tutorial6 necromancy_2

Ah look! A graveyard. A necromancer's paradise. Here, we are going to teach
you about follower mechanics. Pick up the spellbook to learn the raise undead
spell. There is also a scroll of amnesia here in case you do not have enough
spell slots to learn the spell. Scrolls of amnesia can be used to forget a
memorised spell and refund your spell points.
%%%%
tutorial6 necromancy_3

Now, use your new spell to raise an undead army! You can do this by casting
the spell on the corpses around you. Once you've done this, head to the cave
to the north
%%%%
tutorial6 necromancy_4

You probably noticed that you can switch places with your allies by
walking into them. This can be a useful tactic for escaping danger and
forcing your ally take enemy attacks for you.
%%%%
tutorial6 necromancy_5

You might want to wait for your allies to catch up with you before proceeding.
Press <input>$cmd[CMD_WAIT]</input> to wait for a single turn.
%%%%
tutorial6 necromancy_6

There is a group of adventurers in the next room who, like you, aspire to
fight in the arena to become the arena champion. Use your undead army and
all that you have learned to kill them. Show them that there can be only
one arena champion! You can use <input>$cmd[CMD_SHOUT]</input> to command
your allies.
%%%%
tutorial6 necromancy_7

Who knows, maybe they were cultists or something? Anyway, Animate skeleton works
on any corpse with a skeleton inside, and also gives you meat in the process.
Unfortunately, uniques don't drop corpses, but there are a few skeletons here
in case you need them. Proceed into the next room whenever you are ready.
%%%%
tutorial6 removing_equipment

If you ever want to remove your equipment because it is hindering your
spellcasting or for other reasons, you can press
<input>$cmd[CMD_REMOVE_ARMOUR]</input> to select which armour you want to
remove.
%%%%
tutorial6 ambush

Where did all of these enemies come from? No matter, use everything you
have learned to defeat the enemy horde!
%%%%
tutorial6 conclusion

Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial and are now ready to
embark on adventures. As a reward, you are allowed to keep everything
you have gained during the tutorial. You should now head to the arena,
which is south and then to the west of the cathedral area. One more thing,
if you want to learn about gods and gain god abilities, you can go to the
cathedral to the southeast. Look out for these blue tutorial panels if you
have questions.
%%%%
tutorial6 death

In DCSS, death will result in your score being saved, followed by your 
save being deleted. In short, there are no extra lives or respawning, so 
do try to be careful. Dying is not the end however- get back into the game
and learn from your mistakes!
%%%%
tutorial6 waiting

You may have noticed that enemies only move when you do. DDGS is turn based,
which means that all actions consist of turns, including movement. So,
take time to consider your tactics and whether they will lead to death.
%%%%
tutorial6 tactics

Rather than rushing into a swarm of enemies, let's try to use better tactics. 
You can wait a single turn by pressing <input>$cmd[CMD_WAIT]</input>. Use 
this to let the enemies come to you, and then attack them one at a time.
%%%%
tutorial6 victory_1

Very well done. Proceed to the next tutorial marker.
%%%%
tutorial6 victory_2

Nice, very nice. Let's head back to the cathedral area to wrap things up.
%%%%
tutorial6 boots

Don't forget your boots!
%%%%
tutorial6 respawning

This is a spawn point. When you die, you will appear at whichever of these you
are closest to. Dying will result in enemies respawning, so be weary of that.
Also, stepping on one of these will cause enemies to respawn as well.
%%%%
tutorial6 shops_2

There is a shop up ahead. These are distinguishable by a yellow panel with
an icon over it, which resembles what the theme of the shop is and what the
owner typically sells. Since you don't have any gold, we will ignore the
merchant for now. Proceed to the door.
%%%%
tutorial6 pressure_plates_1

This here is what we call a 'pressure plate.' Stepping on it will cause a
variety of good and interesting things to happen, so there is little reason
not to step on one when you get the chance.
%%%%
tutorial6 magic_pointers_1

Flame tongue has a short reach, but has a high chance of hitting an opponent.
Throw flame has less accuracy, but allows you to attack enemies that are far away.
If you are unable to learn one or both of these spells right now, training your
spellcasting and leveling up will give you more spell points to spend on spells.
%%%%
tutorial6 magic_pointers_2

Remember that at any point you can toggle which skills are receiving
experience via the skill interface (accessible by the spell tile above the
inventory area). You might want to toggle them such that spellcasting is being
prioritized, since this allows you to memorise more spells among other benefits,
such as reducing the chance of spells failing. Do this by clicking on
spellcasting so that its percentage is sizable and adjust your other skills
accordingly. Note that you can only train skills if you have means of training
them. For example, you need a fire spell memorised to train fire magic.
%%%%
tutorial6 magic_pointers_3

One more thing before we try magic out. Your success chance of casting a spell
is affected by how heavy your equipment is (which is typically proportional to
a piece of armour's AC rating). You might want to switch your armour out for
the robes you started with. Removing equipment takes 5 turns, and equipping
equipment takes another 5, so be sure to have your equipment figured out
before entering battle.
%%%%
tutorial6 jewelry_4

Here is a ring to help you out with training your spellcasting. It will
increase your total reserves of mana, allowing you to cast more spells before
running out of juice. Jewelry can have a variety of other useful properties,
such as granting resistances to certain elements and increasing your stats. The
menu for equipping jewelry can be accessed using
<input>$cmd[CMD_WEAR_JEWELLERY]</input><localtiles>.
%%%%
tutorial6 resting_reminder

Remember that you can regain your health after combat by resting with
<input>$cmd[CMD_REST]</input>.
%%%%
tutorial6 strategy_1

Through this door is a dangerous magic using kobold that will summon more
powerful enemies to fight you. Magic users typically have high HD (Hit Dice),
and are therefore resistant to magic and have high spellpower. They do, however,
have low AC (armour class). So the best strategy here would be to rush the kobold
down and kill it using melee attacks before it can do anything. Or, alterantively,
you can use your ranged weapons to attack it from a distance.
%%%%
tutorial6 cursed_equipment

A note on cursed equipment. Artifact items are often times cursed, and will
still be functionable, but not all that desirable. So, if you see a shiny sword
in a store and think that you a purchasing the best weapon in the game, you
might be disappointed if it ends up being cursed. Buying equipment that does
not specifically state it is 'not cursed' is therefore a gamble,
so caution should be taken. Also, it is a good idea to use a "scroll of identity"
on an unidentified item before carelessly equipping it.

%%%%
tutorial6 gold

Lucky you, you just found a treasure trove! Gold is a valuable resource, since
it allows you to acquire better weapons and armour, new spells, and many other
things from shops. You will occasionally find gold scattered around like here,
but your main method for making gold will be fighting in the arena. You can go
back to the merchant we found earlier and purchase better equipment if you want.
%%%%
tutorial6 pressure_plates_2

Here is a pressure plate. Typically, stepping on one of these will cause
something to happen, but this one is not active at the moment. We will be
coming back to it later for a part of the tutorial, so you can ignore it for
now.
%%%%
tutorial6 adventuring_3

That concludes the tutorial on magic fundamentals and jewelry. Let's move onto
something a little more interesting before you're allowed to go. If you went ahead
and stepped on that pressure plate over in the corner, the wall to the
south should have opened up, and, additionally, that pressure plate you saw
earlier should now be active. Buy whatever you want from the merchant, and then
go ahead and step on the pressure plate. Enter the swamp area to the west
afterwords.
%%%%
tutorial6 adventuring_4

Hopefully you're not too shaken up after that explosion- we had to set up
the explosives while you were out adventuring. Or maybe the pressure plate
that you stepped on earlier activated the pressure plate that triggered the
explosives? Hmmmm. At any rate, head south.
